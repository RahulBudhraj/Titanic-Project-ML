Machine Learning Project : Titanic Survival

This project contains create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex, age, sibsp, embarrked and cabin class which accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.

Prediction is done using Logistic Regression Algorithm.
You can find the dataset attached to it.
